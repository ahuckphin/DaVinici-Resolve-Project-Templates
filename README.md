Applied to sample video in Resolve:

1. audio equalizer to reduce audio gain below 100Hz (low frequency rolloff) and increase audio gain above 100Hz. This was following comparison of frequency analysis of identically shot iPhone SE (20200) and DJI Pocket 2 videos, the latter I preferred. The audio equalizer attempts to make the DJI Pocket 2 frquency mimic the iPhone's. 

2. colour correction to slightly boost gain, saturation and contrast (5% boost each)
   gain 1.0 to 1.05
   saturation 50.0 to 52.5
   contrast 1.0 to 1.05

## iPhone 
30fps timeline
